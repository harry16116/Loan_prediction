# Loan_Prediction
## Project Description
This project is designed to analyze and predict loan approval statuses based on a range of demographic and financial factors. It employs a dataset that includes various attributes such as gender, marital status, education, employment status, income levels, credit history, and property area among others.

## Data Analysis and Statistical Approaches (Data_AnalysisStatistic_Approach.ipynb):
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual and statistical analysis to understand the distributions and relationships of various features in the dataset.
* Statistical Testing: Includes hypothesis testing to determine significant differences and associations between features.
* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and necessary transformations to prepare data for modeling.
## Null Values Prediction (Null_Values__Prediction.ipynb):
* Missing Data Imputation: Techniques to handle missing data in the dataset, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of predictive models.
* Prediction of Null Values: Leveraging predictive modeling to estimate missing values based on patterns found in the data, specifically using logistic regression.
## Datasets:
* train.csv: Contains the training data with 614 entries and 13 attributes including a target variable Loan_Status.
* test.csv: Comprises testing data with 367 samples and 12 attributes used to validate the performance of trained models.
